# Audio Files

Place your sample audio file here:

- **sample.mp3** - This should be your AI receptionist demo audio

The AudioCard component is configured to load `/audio/sample.mp3`.

If you don't have an audio file yet, you can:
1. Record a sample AI receptionist conversation
2. Use any MP3 file as a placeholder for testing
3. The player will show an error if the file is missing, but the rest of the site will work fine
